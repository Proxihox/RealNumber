# The Real Number Project

Introducing a new set of classes in c++, which offers superior computational accuract as opposed to pre-existing ints and floats.

## Frac

frac is a simple class which can handle all rational number computation (within the limits of long long).

## Rnum

rnum is a more complex class which is able to handle calculations involving roots and powers of any order with great precision.
